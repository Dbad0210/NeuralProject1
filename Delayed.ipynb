        "Everyone who has flown has experienced a delayed or cancelled flight. Both airlines and airports would like to improve their on-time performance and predict when a flight will be delayed or cancelled several days in advance. You are being hired to build a model that can predict if a flight will be delayed. To learn more, you must schedule a meeting with your client (me). To schedule an appointment with your client, send an event request through Google Calendar for a 15 minute meeting. Both you and your project partner must attend the meeting. Come prepared with questions to ask your client. Remember that your client is not a data scientist and you will need to explain things in a way that is easy to understand. Make sure that your communications are efficient, thought out, and not redundant as your client might get frustrated and \"fire\" you (this only applies to getting information from your client, this does not necessary apply to asking for help with the actual project itself - you should continuously ask questions for getting help).\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project you must go through most all steps in the checklist. You must write responses for all items as done in the homeworks, however sometimes the item will simply be \"does not apply\". Keep your progress and thoughts organized in this document and use formatting as appropriate (using markdown to add headers and sub-headers for each major part). Some changes to the checklist:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Do not do the final part (launching the product).\n",
        "* Your presentation will be done as information written in this document in a dedicated section (no slides or anything like that). It should include high-level summary of your results (including what you learned about the data, the \"accuracy\" of your model, what features were important, etc). It should be written for your client, not your professor or teammates. It should include the best summary plots/graphics/data points.\n",
        "* The models and hyperparameters you should consider during short-listing and fine-tuning will be released at a later time (dependent on how far we get over the next two weeks).\n",
        "* Data retrieval must be automatic as part of the code (so it can easily be re-run and grab the latest data). Do not commit any data to the repository.\n",
        "* Your submission must include a pickled final model along with this notebook."
